This application can be used by opening our integraded terminal and running the command 'node index.js'. This will prompt questions regarding what you would like the logo to be made into. The questions include the text, text color, shape of logo, and color of the shape of the logo. After these question have been answered a new file on the left named 'logo.svg' will be created.
